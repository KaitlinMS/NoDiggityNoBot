## Setting Up the Bot

The discord.js guide has great installation instructions for Windows, MacOS, and Linux here:
https://discordjs.guide/preparations/#installing-node-js

## Running the Bot

In Terminal on a Mac, navigate to the directory and run:
```
python3 bot.py
```

In the Command Prompt or Power Shell on Windows, navigate to the directory and run:
```
python bot.py
```

After running this, the bot will log into Discord, and you should see it in the list of online users in your server.
